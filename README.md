# JavaScript Progress Bar Loader

### Description:
* This is an example site where by the means of a button the progress bars are loaded. 
* Each bar loads in its own, adequate time for the corresponding Internet bandwith. 
* Every button represents certain file size.

This is a small project, but there might be coming more soon.
